# MediaPipe Sample Applications

## Introduction
Google MediaPipe offers ready-to-use yet customizable Python solutions as a prebuilt Python package. 

We provide example scripts for performing inference from video file and video stream with `run_video_file.py` and `run_video_stream.py`. For detailed instructions execute ```run_video_file.py --help``` or ```run_video_stream.py --help```

You can verify that MediaPipe library is installed using:

### Python bindings for 32bit version

```
pip3 install mediapipe-rpi4 tqdm
```

### Python bindings for 64bit version

Pre-built wheels for Python 3.7 64bit OS were not available at the moment of writing of this article, so we compiled and shared them ourselves.

```
wget https://files.seeedstudio.com/ml/mediapipe/mediapipe-0.8-cp37-cp37m-linux_aarch64.whl
pip3 install mediapipe-0.8-cp37-cp37m-linux_aarch64.whl
